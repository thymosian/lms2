# LMS - AI-Powered Compliance & Safety Training Platform

LMS is a sophisticated, enterprise-ready Learning Management System (LMS) designed to automate and streamline compliance and safety training. It leverages a state-of-the-art AI pipeline to transform raw documents into interactive, high-quality learning experiences.

---

## 🏗 Architecture Overview

LMS is built on a modern, scalable stack:

- **Frontend**: Next.js 16 (App Router) for a performant, SEO-friendly user experience.
- **Backend**: Next.js Server Actions and API Routes for robust business logic.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM for type-safe data management.
- **AI Pipeline (v4.6)**: Multi-stage orchestration using Google Vertex AI and Gemini for content generation and validation.
- **Authentication**: Isolated sessions for different roles (`admin` vs `worker`) using NextAuth.v5.
- **Infrastructure**: Deployment-ready scripts for staging and production, including PM2 and Cloudflare Tunnel support.

## ✨ Features

- **Multi-Tenant Org Management**: Complete isolation between different organizations.
- **AI-Driven Course Authoring**: Generate rich articles, slides, and quizzes from PDF, DOCX, and XLSX files.
- **PHI Scanning**: Automatic detection of Protected Health Information in uploaded documents.
- **Interactive Learning**: Slide decks, quizzes with archetypes, and real-time progress tracking.
- **Compliance Reporting**: Automated generation of evidence packs for auditors (e.g., CARF compliance).
- **Secure Attestations**: Cryptographically logged digital signatures for course completions.
